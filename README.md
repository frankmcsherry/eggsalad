A messy e-graph implementation

This is a learning project, drawn primarily from [egg](https://crates.io/crates/egg).
If you would like an e-graph implementation, I recommend that one rather than this one.

The project was initially developed as part of [this blog post](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2024-10-19.md), and is used by other similar projects.
